The Irishman (2019, Martin Scorsese) - finished watching on Netflix on 11th July 2024, 12.10am. Good movie I liked it. Some good soundtrack including "The Time is Now" by The Golddiggers and "In the Still of the Night" by The Five Satins. Took the SOA FAM exam today. I think I did badly. Had dinner with Jimmy Flaherty at Huaraches Moroleon. Also watched Rick and Morty S05E05 at 1am. 

15th July 2024, Monday - Finished reading "Dune - House Atreides" today. Have been working on it the past 3-4 weeks or so, can't remember when I started, might have been after I got back from NYC. Have been working on the Dune books this summer, though mostly the prequels by Brian Herbert - the 3 books on the war against the thinking machines, House Harkonnen, and now House Atreides. I should get the House Corrino book next, or maybe I should read Heretics of Dune by Frank Herbert. Resumed drinking the Kirkland Bordeaux Superieur (blue label) red wine. It is really bland. Do not buy again. Did exam P questions 121-150 in the morning. Started packing my stuff and moved some of it to the storage. It was super hot today. Did exam P questions 151-180 in the evening. Some of them feel kind of non-trivial and I was puzzled over a few questions for quite a while. Made 3 mistakes in each. I should review the mistakes. Listening to ELO as I drink my wine. It reminds me of the early days in this apartment at the start of fall semester almost 2 years ago. How far we have come.
