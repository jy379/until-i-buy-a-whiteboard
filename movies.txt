The Irishman (2019, Martin Scorsese) - finished watching on Netflix on 11th July 2024, 12.10am. Good movie I liked it. Some good soundtrack including "The Time is Now" by The Golddiggers and "In the Still of the Night" by The Five Satins. Took the SOA FAM exam today. I think I did badly. Had dinner with Jimmy Flaherty at Huaraches Moroleon.
